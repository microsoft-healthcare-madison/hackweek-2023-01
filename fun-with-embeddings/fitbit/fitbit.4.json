  "userQuestion": "How can I represent step counts from my fitbit?",
  "draftAnswer": "To represent step counts from your fitbit, you can use the FHIR Observation resource. This resource is used to capture data that is measured or derived from a patient. The Observation resource has a `valueQuantity` element which is used to represent the measured value, such as the number of steps taken. Additionally, the Observation resource can also be used to capture the source of the data, such as the fitbit device. The Observation resource should not be used to record clinical diagnosis about a patient or subject that are typically captured in the Condition resource or the ClinicalImpression resource. For more information about the Observation resource, please refer to the [FHIR Observation documentation](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/observation.html) and the [FHIR ObservationDefinition documentation](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/observationdefinition.html).",

For example, the AllergyIntolerance resource represents a\npatient allergies, MedicationStatement resource: medications taken by a\npatient, FamilyMemberHistory resource: a patient's family history,\nProcedure resource: information about a procedure, and\nQuestionnaireResponse resource: a set of answers to a set of questions.\nThe Observation resource should not be used to record clinical diagnosis\nabout a patient or subject that are typically captured in the Condition\nresource or the ClinicalImpression resource. The Observation resource is\noften referenced by the Condition resource to provide specific\nsubjective and objective data to support its assertions. There will\nhowever be situations of overlap. For example, a response to a question\nof \"have you ever taken illicit drugs\" could in principle be represented\nusing MedicationStatement, but most systems would treat such an\nassertion as an Observation. In some cases, such as when source data is\ncoming from an HL7 v2 [] feed, a system might not have information that\nallows it to distinguish diagnosis, allergy and other \"specialized\"\ntypes of observations from laboratory, vital sign and other observation\ntypes intended to be conveyed with this resource. In those\ncircumstances, such specialized observations may also appear using this\nresource. Adhering to such convention is an appropriate use of\nObservation.

Most observations are simple\nname/value pair assertions with some metadata, but some observations\ngroup other observations together logically, or even are multi-component\nobservations. Note that the DiagnosticReport resource provides a\nclinical or workflow context for a set of observations and the\nObservation resource is referenced by DiagnosticReport to represent\nlaboratory, imaging, and other clinical and diagnostic data to form a\ncomplete report.\n\nUses for the Observation resource include:\n\n Vital signs such as body weight, blood pressure, and temperature\n Laboratory Data like blood glucose, or an estimated GFR\n Imaging results like bone density or fetal measurements\n Clinical Findings^(*) such as abdominal tenderness\n Device measurements such as EKG data or Pulse Oximetry data\n Clinical assessment tools such as APGAR or a Glasgow Coma Score\n Personal characteristics: such as eye-color\n Social history like tobacco use, family support, or cognitive status\n Core characteristics like pregnancy status, or a death assertion\n\n^(*)The boundaries between clinical findings and disorders remains a\nchallenge in medical ontology. Refer the Boundaries section below and in\nCondition for general guidance. These boundaries can be clarified by\nprofiling Observation for a particular use case.\n\n"

It provides the definition of observations,\nwhich are used as input or produced as outcome of these products and\nservices. The focus of the definitional aspects of ObservationDefinition\nis not on the action of performing observations of that kind. Rather, it\nis on the outcome of the observations. An instance of\nObservationDefinition represents a set of constraints applicable to the\nvalue produced by observations of this kind. This set of constraints may\nhave two utilities: 1) It guides the entry of the result of an\nobservation of the kind defined. 2) It helps the consumer of the results\nof observations of that kind, to interpret properly these results.\n\nFor instance, in a catalog of laboratory in vitro diagnostic services,\nthe ObservationDefinition resources describe the observations that\nshould be provided by the orderer alongside with an ordered service\n(questions asked at order entry or at specimen collection, prior\nresults) as well as the observations that will be reported once the\nservice has been performed.\n\nIn a catalog of medications, ObservationDefinition resources can be used\nto describe observations the result thereof need to be checked against\nthe prescription of a particular medicinal product (therapeutic range,\nunits ...)\n\nIn the catalog of tests of an in vitro diagnostic device,\nObservationDefinition resources can be used to characterize (absolute\nrange, unit, decimal precision, critical values ...) the observations\nthat will be produced by the IVD tests performed by the device.\n\nObservationDefinition may be used to characterize observations from any\ndiscipline.\n\n"
